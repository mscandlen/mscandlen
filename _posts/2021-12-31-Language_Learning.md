### Abstract

This project utilizes natural language processing methods to analyze why Reddit users are learning a new language (L2).
Users are classified into motivation profiles based on their self-disclosed reason for learning Spanish (i.e. learning Spanish for a job, for a partner, moving to a new country, etc.).
The model builds a motivation profile for each user and then classifies users into one of six groups based on their motivation: 0) native speaker, 1) culture, 2) interpersonal relationships, 3) school, 4) career, 5) traveling/moving.
The models uses a text corpus of Reddit posts.
