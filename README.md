I am a current Masters student at Georgia Institute of Technology studying Computer Science, concentrating in Machine Learning. My research interests are natural language processing and sociolinguistics, focusing on linguistic variation on social media.

Some of my completed research projects evaluating language-learning online, understanding the semantic use of disfluencies in social media posts, and generating adversarial fake reviews.
