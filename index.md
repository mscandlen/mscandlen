I am a current Masters student at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/) studying Computer Science, concentrating in Machine Learning. My research interests are **natural language processing** and **sociolinguistics**, focusing on *linguistic variation on social media*.

Some of my completed research projects evaluating language-learning online, understanding the semantic use of disfluencies in social media posts, and generating adversarial fake reviews.
