I am a Data Scientist at HP in San Diego, CA. I completed my Masters in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology in 2023, concentrating in Machine Learning. My research interests are natural language processing and big data analytics.

Some of my completed research projects include evaluating language-learning online, generating adversarial fake reviews, and developing a human-in-the-loop algorithm to identify bot accounts on Twitter.
