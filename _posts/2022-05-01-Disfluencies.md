*Uh* and *Um* Excerpt

### Abstract

Disfluencies, such as silent pauses and filled pauses with um and uh, are used in spontaneous speech, but these utterances still carry meaning about the statement to the listener. 
This paper will first review previous research on the pragmatic meaning listeners derive from hearing disfluencies, focusing on um and uh. 
A corpus experiment on text posts from Reddit will be conducted to understand how speakers use um and uh in written text online to further evaluate the pragmatic meaning.
