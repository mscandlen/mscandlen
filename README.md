I am a current Masters student at Georgia Institute of Technology studying Computer Science, concentrating in Machine Learning. My research interests are natural language processing and big data analytics.

Some of my completed research projects include evaluating language-learning online, generating adversarial fake reviews, and developing a human-in-the-loop algorithm to identify bot accounts on Twitter.
