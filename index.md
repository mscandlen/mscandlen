I am a current Masters student at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/) studying Computer Science, specializing in Machine Learning. My research interests are **natural language processing** and **big data analytics**. I earned a Bachelors in Computer Science from Georgia Institute of Technology in 2022.

Some of my completed research projects include evaluating language-learning online, generating adversarial fake reviews, and developing a human-in-the-loop algorithm to identify bot accounts on Twitter.
