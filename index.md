I am a current Masters student at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/) studying Computer Science, specializing in Machine Learning. My research interests are **natural language processing** and **sociolinguistics**, focusing on *linguistic variation on social media*. I earned a Bachelors in Computer Science from Georgia Institute of Technology in 2022.

Some of my completed research projects include evaluating language-learning online, understanding the semantic use of disfluencies in social media posts, and generating adversarial fake reviews.
