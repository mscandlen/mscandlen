title: Generate, Explain, and Maintain Style (GEMS): Generation of Adversarial Reviews
categories: Machine-Learning
---

### Abstract

We propose a review generation framework called GEMS (Generate, Explain, and Maintain Style) to improve upon fake review detection, explainability, and generalizability from one domain to another. Online reviews have become increasingly ubiquitous, and users trust and seek them out to make informed decisions about spending their time and money. Unfortunately, bad actors can use online reviews for malicious purposes, such as targeted review bombing, or propping up a scam product with positive reviews. Detection results have improved over the last few years, but in order to increase adoption, users must understand and trust AI moderation decisions. We propose to train a generative adversarial network to include labels such as semantic and stylistic features that can then be used to explain discriminator detection. We also propose to identify and cluster features between related review domains (restaurants, movies, hotels, doctors) to improve generalization of detecting reviews.
