I am a Data Scientist at HP in San Diego, CA. I earned my Masters in Computer Science at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/) in 2023, concentrating in Machine Learning. My research interests are **natural language processing** and **big data analytics**.

Some of my completed research projects include evaluating language-learning online, generating adversarial fake reviews, and developing a human-in-the-loop algorithm to identify bot accounts on Twitter.
