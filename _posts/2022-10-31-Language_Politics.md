Perceiving Southernness and Political Ideology in Speech Excerpt

### Abstract

In the urban centers in the US South, the Southern Vowel Shift (SVS) has been retreating (Dodsworth & Kohn, 2012).
These changes create a dichotomy in regional variation that resembles the contrast of liberal urban centers to conservative rural areas (Scala & Johnson, 2017).
This new distinction suggests that speakers with phonetic features of the SVS might be perceived as politically conservative (Amira et al., 2018).
We recorded the speech of young adults from Georgia and used clips from a reading passage to ask American listeners to rate the speakers’ perceived “southernness” and separately asked other listeners to rate the speakers’ perceived“ political conservatism.”
We measure these perceptions against one another, against the speakers’ actual vowel measurements, and against the speakers’ self-reported gender/ethnicity.
